# contacts-frontend-mithril-redux


**contacts-frontend-mithril-redux** is part of "contacts" project that is an initiative where we try to explore frontend and backend implementations in order to better understand it cutting-edge features. This repository presents a mithriljs based frontend application.

## status

This repository belongs to the Contacts reference initiative started in 2020.

Its purpose was to understand how different stacks shape design decisions around the same domain model.

As of 2026, this project is frozen.

The exploration phase has been completed.  
My current focus is depth, invariants, and system coherence rather than stack comparison.

This code remains as historical reference.
